## About Pareto Chart ##
A Pareto Chart is a graph that indicates the frequency of defects, as well as their cumulative impact.
Pareto Charts are useful to find the defects to prioritize 
in order to observe the greatest overall improvement.

##About Bump Chart ###
A Bump Chart is used to compare two dimensions against each other using one of the Measure value.
They are very useful for exploring the changes in Rank of a value over a time dimension or place dimension or some other
dimension relevant to the analysis. The Bump Chart takes two dimensions with zero or more measures.

Hope it is helpful.
